# Social-media-analysis
In this project, I analyzed social media data across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter using sentiment analysis:
🧠 Sentiment Extraction & Classification Using TextBlob, I computed polarity scores from post content to label each text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. This laid the foundation for emotional diagnostics throughout the dataset.

☁️ Word Cloud Visualization I generated word clouds to identify the most common keywords and themes across posts, revealing dominant conversations centered around gratitude, lifestyle, and wellness—suggesting strong emotional storytelling in user-generated content.

🌐 Sentiment by Country Mapping sentiment distribution geographically, I observed that countries like Thailand, Jamaica, Columbia exhibited higher positivity, while others showed regional spikes in negative sentiment—offering insights for tailoring localized messaging and crisis monitoring.

👤 User-Level Analysis By aggregating sentiment per user, I identified potential users as brand advocates based on consistently positive content. This approach is scalable for influencer detection or audience segmentation strategies.

⏰ Temporal Sentiment Patterns Analyzing by hour, I found that Instagram posts around 9–11 PM had the highest positivity rates, whereas Twitter showed more negative sentiment in the early hours (2 AM)—highlighting the value of sentiment-aware posting schedules.

🏷️ Hashtag Sentiment Dynamics I deconstructed hashtag usage to uncover top 10 hashtags and top 10 retweeted hashtag.
